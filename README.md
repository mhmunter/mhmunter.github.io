Set title for "online-reputation-management". While this is only part of the services offered, it seems like the most likely search request. We can monitor and adjust as needed.

added ID of "search-engine-optimization" to connect it to dirctory in header.

added accessablity to the images. 

changed div with class of header to header tag to better orginize. 

removed anchor tag CSS because it didnt have any functionallity.
